# Advanced-Programming-Java

This repository contains my CMPE2004 course materials and studies on "Advanced Programming" at my university.

The course is based on "Introduction to Java Programming, Eleventh Edition (2018)" by Liang. I appreciate this book for its engaging teaching approach. I will add interesting and insightful examples from the book. According to the book's preface:

"This comprehensive version covers fundamentals of programming, object-oriented programming, GUI programming, data structures, algorithms, concurrency, networking, database, and Web programming. It is designed to prepare students to become proficient Java programmers."

According to the syllabus, it covers the following contents:
